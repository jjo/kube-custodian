kube-custodian - Kubernetes cleanup tool

## Purpose

On Kubernetes clusters for development, it's pretty common to have
workloads that become forgotten by developers, holding resources thus
potentially voiding new workloads from scheduling.

`kube-custodian` will make for later deletion those workloads (Deployments,
StatefulSets, Jobs, Pods) lacking `--required-labels`.

For example, to mark for later deletion all workloads not having the `created_by`
label, run:

```bash
$ kube-custodian -v --namespace=default --dry-run run --tag-ttl 24h --required-labels created_by
```

Obviously, remove `--dry-run` to _actually_ mark them :), it'll add an
annotation as

  `kube-custodian.bitnami.com/expiration-time: <current epoch secs>`

Then, 24h later same run as above will:
- Update any new workload without this above annotation
- Delete all workloads for which:

  (`kube-custodian.bitnami.com/expiration-time` + `tag-ttl`) >= `now`



## Install
